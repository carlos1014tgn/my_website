					<h4>Who am I?</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>I'm an engineer from Barcelona. I started coding at university and sticked to it after I saw it's potential.</p>

					<p>I've always been curious so I've been exploring related technologies since the. Currently I'm exploring the data and blockchain sectors as I think will be key habilities in the future world.</p>

					<p>I have worked in a datawarehouse for the banking industry and I'm currently working for Amazon, where I develop optimization projects saving thousands of dollars to the company.</p>

					<p>I got introduced to cryptocurrencies in 2016 and I'm trying to figure out how to apply my knowledge to the sector. </p>

					<h5>My projects</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>My final project at university was building a modular drone. I used ML and sensors to make it follow people and I also created a topography module based on a sonar and a python ETL process.</p>
					<p>I'm currently developing a trading bot for cryptocurrencies. In order to feed it I'm collecting data over the internet and extracting interesting information using on-chain analysis over Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.</p>

					<h5>What I Know</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>I studied industrial engineering and started coding as soon as I saw the potential of programming. Currently I analyze businesses and I code the solutions to optimize them.</p>
					<p>Knowing about statistics, businesses, processes and coding, allows me to detect what can be improved and calculate the costs and savings before starting to develop an MVP.</p>
					<p>I know Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Java, AWS and some ML libraries. I'm currently learning JavaScript and Solidity.</p>

					<h5>Data & Blockchain</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Currently, both of these worlds are growing exponentially and it is a trend I don't see close to an end. </p>

					<p>When we mix these two concepts, the on-chain analytics is the first place to go. Currently there is little documentation in on-chain analytics but this is a challenge I'm happy to take.</p>

					<h5>My Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>My first goal is to start feeding my trading bot with better and better data in order to improve it's performance. This project has no end as it can always be improved.</p>
				<p>Once the performance of the bot exceeds the performance of it's base assets, I'm planning to open a dhedge account to let others follow me in this path.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile I achive these goals, I'll keep publishing interesting metrics I discover in the Analytics tab.</p>
