					<h4>Who am I?</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>I'm an engineer from Barcelona. I started coding at university and sticked to it after I saw it's potential.</p>

					<p>I have worked in a datawarehouse for the banking industry and I'm currently working for Amazon, where I develop optimization projects saving thousands of dollars to the company.</p>

					<p>I got introduced to cryptocurrencies in 2016 and I'm trying to figure out how to apply my knowledge to the sector.</p>

					<h5>My projects</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>My final project at university was building a modular drone. I used ML and sensors to make it follow people and I also created a topography module based on a sonar and a python ETL process.</p>
					<p>I'm currently developing a trading bot for cryptocurrencies.</p>

					<h5>What I Know</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>I studied industrial engineering and started coding as soon as I saw the potential of programming. Currently I analyze businesses and I code the solutions to optimize them.</p>
					<p>Knowing about statistics, businesses, processes and coding, allows me to detect what can be improved and calculate the costs and savings before starting to develop an MVP.</p>
					<p>I know Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Java, AWS and some ML libraries. I'm currently learning JavaScript and Solidity.</p>

					<h5>Data & Blockchain</h5>
					<hr>
					<p></p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>After almost two years of supporting my system at the lab Iâ€™m ready to learn something new. I'll collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my blog (SayHelloWorld.co) & youtube channel.</p>
				<p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
